This is a comic website created to spread the awareness about going digital so as to help save trees and papers.

# Project Title
The title of this project is "Save Trees, Go Digital".


# Project Description
This is a comic project aiming to inspire and motivate people to go digital when there is an option, in order to save trees and protect the environment. Our initial goal was to create an entirely educational comic, showing how papers are made, how they are used in different ways and offer solutions to decrease paper consumption. However, it turned out that this would not suit the comic medium and lack entertainment and interactivity. Thus, we decided to just focus on one kind of paper usage and tell a story based on it. We strived the project to be both entertaining and educational at the same time, by using sounds, interactivity, and colorful aesthetics for both our website and the comic itself. We hope people will be inspired to choose to go digital when there is the option and not waste paper when there is no apparent need. 


# Process
Our idea for the story came from a discussion we had during class, so we only needed to work on the scenes and the website. We made the comic solely on Photoshop, finding images online and combining/contrasting them together to create each of the scenes. As for the website, we used HTML, CSS and Javascript, as well as the AOS library to add scrolling effects. Upon entering our website, one will be welcomed by a poster on saving trees and a dark background to show the seriousness and the gravity of the issue. The interactor can then go to three different sections: Scenes, About Project and About Authors. The background in the three sections are a lot more colorful than the one in the homepage to inspire hope and optimism albeit the dire situation of our environment. 


# Reflection

We met most of our initial goals and expectations for the project. We were determined to raise awareness on saving papers, and although our ideas changed throughout the project, we believe that we were able to tell a story that will, even on a small scale, prompt people to look around themselves and reflect on how they can do better as a paper consumer and as a world citizen. We think that we could have added more interactivity to our project, but due to time and team constraints, we were unable to. Nonetheless, we are proud of our final version and it was really enjoyable to work on it!
